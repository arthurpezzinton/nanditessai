<p class="lead">
    The <strong>NandiTESS.ai</strong> journey is just beginning. What was once an ambitious dream â€” using artificial intelligence to predict and validate exoplanets â€” is now becoming a reality, driven by brilliant young minds like <strong>Ana Luiza</strong>, <strong>Dante Castro</strong>, <strong>Davi Santos</strong>, and <strong>VinÃ­cius Pereira</strong>.
</p>
<p class="lead">
    They have proven that young Brazilians can be at the forefront of global science. Now, together, we move toward the next steps:

    <h4>1. Stellar Distance Simulator</h4>
    <p>An interactive tool to visualize the distance between detected exoplanets and Earth, using 3D data based on real astronomical coordinates.</p>

    <h4>2. Scientific Validation via AI</h4>
    <p>An AI system that replicates the steps of the scientific method to automatically validate whether a candidate has characteristics compatible with confirmed exoplanets.</p>

    <h4>3. Interactive Star Map</h4>
    <p>A 3D representation of the analyzed objects, highlighting location, brightness, and statistical relevance to facilitate space exploration.</p>

    <h4>4. Smart Candidate Filter</h4>
    <p>Users will be able to adjust parameters such as radius, mass, temperature, and transit time â€” and see in real-time which candidates most resemble real planets.</p>

    <h4>5. Discovery Publication with Credit</h4>
    <p>The community will be able to publish scientific articles within the platform and receive credit for validated discoveries.</p>

    <h4>6. Gamified Exploration for Schools</h4>
    <p>An interactive environment with challenges, rankings, and rewards for young students, encouraging learning in physics, math, astronomy, and data science.</p>

    <h4>7. Connection with NASA Researchers</h4>
    <p>An open channel for scientists and educators worldwide to track community discoveries and collaborate directly with the results.</p>

    <h3 class="fw-bold">ðŸš€ A New Generation of Explorers</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Ana Luiza</strong>, <strong>Dante</strong>, <strong>Davi</strong>, and <strong>VinÃ­cius</strong> represent a new kind of scientist: one who learns fast, shares discoveries, and believes the sky is not the limit â€” it's just the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>NandiTESS.ai</strong> moves forward with them, and with everyone who believes the future of science is collaborative, accessible, and inspiring.
    </p>
    <p class="fw-semibold">Let's go together. The universe is waiting.</p>
